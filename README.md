# omarchy-will-emacs

omarchy-will-emacs provides an Emacs experience that integrates with your omarchy setup. The motivation of this library is to provide a matching set of emacs themes to match those of omarchy. Once I've accomplished that I'd like to look at curating a resonable and performant set of packages. 

## Screenshot
This is what you'll be presented with after installing will-emacs. (emacs is on the right)

## Features

- 🎨 **Automatic theme synchronization** with omarchy themes
- 📦 **One-command installation** via pacman integration.
- 🛠 **Essential packages** pre-configured (magit, projectile, ivy, counsel)  

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willwillis/omarchy-will-emacs.git
cd omarchy-will-emacs
./install.sh
```

This will:
1. Install Emacs and essential system packages via pacman
2. Copy configuration files to `~/.config/emacs`
3. Install the `will-emacs` launcher in `~/.local/bin`
4. Set up automatic theme synchronization with omarchy

## Usage

Launch Will's configured Emacs:
```bash
will-emacs
```

The regular `emacs` command remains unchanged, so you can still use vanilla Emacs if needed.

## Theme Synchronization

omarchy-will-emacs automatically detects your current omarchy theme and applies the corresponding ef-theme:

![will-emacs theme sync](https://i.imgur.com/7cwMcIe.gif)

notice in the screen recording above emacs actually detects the theme change before omarchy. 

- **gruvbox** → ef-autumn
- **tokyo-night** → ef-night
- **catppuccin** → ef-duo-dark 
- **catppuccin-latte** → ef-frost
- **rose-pine** → ef-rosa
- **nord** → ef-maris-dark
- **kanagawa** → ef-owl
- **everforest** → ef-bio
- **matte-black** → ef-dark
- **osaka-jade** → ef-elea-dark
- **ristretto** → ef-melissa-dark

you can preview all `ef-themes` [here](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures) and omarchy themes [here](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/52/themes)


Themes sync automatically when you change your omarchy theme, or manually with `M-x will-omarchy-sync-now`.

## Package Philosophy (subject to change)

Following omarchy's opinionated approach:

- **Ivy/Counsel/Swiper** for completion framework
- **Magit** for Git integration
- **Projectile** for project management
- **Which-key** for discoverable keybindings
- **ef-themes** for beautiful, accessible themes
- **JetBrains Mono** font (matches omarchy terminal)

## Configuration Structure

```
~/.config/emacs/
├── init.el                     # Main configuration
└── omarchy-ef-theme-sync.el    # Theme synchronization
```

## Manual Theme Control

```elisp
;; Sync immediately
(omarchy-ef-sync-now)

;; Start file watching (automatic)
(omarchy-ef-start-file-watch)

;; Stop file watching
(omarchy-ef-stop-file-watch)

;; Use timer-based syncing (fallback)
(omarchy-ef-start-sync)
(omarchy-ef-stop-sync)
```

## Customization

To add your own configuration, edit `~/.config/emacs/init.el` or create additional files in `~/.config/emacs/`.

The theme mapping can be customized by modifying `omarchy-ef-theme-mapping` in the configuration.

## Requirements

- [omarchy](https://github.com/willhop/omarchy) Linux distribution
- Emacs 27+
- Git (for package management)

## Caveats
- I have to run `will-omarchy-start-file-watch` in order to have themes switch automatically, maybe someone can help get this working automagically. see `(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'will-omarchy-setup)` in `init.el`
- I've gone through a chosen a close ef-theme for the background, perhaps I should be looking for the closest neovim equivalent. idk.
- naming. I stink at it. help me please.
  - repo: omarchy-will-emacs
  - package: will-omarch-emacs
  - launcher: will-emacs
- omarchy's neovim setup is kinda cool, I'd like to get some of it's config/functionality into this config once I have some time.

## Contributing

This project mirrors omarchy's approach to system configuration. Contributions should maintain the opinionated, batteries-included philosophy while keeping the configuration approachable for omarchy users.
